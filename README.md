# TaskSpace-control-for-AerialManipulator

This code analyzed the IMPC controller performance in Aerial manipulator in task space. The proposed aerial manipulator consists mainly of two parts; a quadrotor and a 2 degree of freedoms (DOFs) robot manipulator, which is attached to the bottom of quadrotor. The robotic manipulator has two revolute joints and the rotation axis of one joint is perpendicular with another joint.

To run the code, the aerial manipulator must be design for the system dynamic. This code uploaded without this model because the model was patented.
